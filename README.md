I built this application in order to immerse myself in full stack development. The application is in many apsects a clone of the NY times best seller website. I did my best to duplicate the portions of the styling that I enjoyed and attempted to make improvenments where I could. I also added login with google oauth so users can read and write reviews about the books on the website. 

This application was built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). I learned a great deal about all of these technologies while building the application. The application is currently hosted on Heroku at https://nytimesbooks.herokuapp.com/.
